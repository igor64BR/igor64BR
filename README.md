# 👋 Hi, I'm Igor Baiocco!

I'm a **full-stack and mobile** developer, passionate about creating solutions that combine **technology and purpose**.  
Currently, I work at **IndustriALL**, collaborating on systems for major industries such as **Samarco, Vale, and Suzano**.

💡 I strongly believe that coding is much more than just writing code — it’s born from brainstorming, empathy, and attention to detail.

### ✨ My philosophy
> “Machines can read any code — but people only read clean code.”

Each project is a new opportunity to learn something — a new technology, something about people, or even about myself.  
If you also believe that, feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/igor-baiocco)! 😄
